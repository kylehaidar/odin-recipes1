    <p> Now, this, this right here is a <strong>TRUE</strong> delicacy in my household, granted it only makes an appearance once every other week or so (because I am a broke college student), but it is absolutely amazing. A steak has to be cooked well, and the only way to cook it is a perfect medium rare temperature. A steak is easy to mess up, but how i cook it, it will be absolutely perfect every single time. Steaks have to be cooked with love, and affection, you must pour your blood sweat and tears into making it, but you also must show it love, and that is how I will teach you.</p>
    <h3>So, what will we need to make this steak?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A thermometer </li>
        <li>A New York Strip steak (or any steak you prefer)</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
        <li>Any seasonings you want (I usually only use salt and pepper)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That is all you need to make a delicious steak!</p>
    <h3>Now, how do we cook this amazing steak?</h3>
    <p>Well, this is not an easy task, but I will ensure it is going to be the best steak of your life</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the plastic wrap off of the packaging holding in your steak, and place it on a cutting board.</li>
        <li>Now season both sides extremely generously, remember, you must also season the inside of the steak, which can only be done on the outside</li>
        <li>Get a searing hot pan at around medium to high heat, and put a little bit of butter</li>
        <li>Now, place the steak onto the pan, but ensure you hear that sizzle noise! </li>
        <li>Sear one side for around 2.5-3.5 minutes, or as long as it  takes to get a perfect sear.</li>
        <li>Now, this is the tricky part, place a <strong>LOT </strong> of butter and tilt the pan towards you so it all ends up in one place</li>
        <li>This is where you add you thyme and rosemary to the steak</li>
        <li>Now, very carefully (I have burned myself a lot doing this) baste the butter onto the steak with a spoon</li>
        <li>Here is where you need to use the thermometer, you must keep checking if the steak reaches 125 degrees fahrenheit, that is when its done </li>
        <li>Once it reaches 125 degrees fahrenheit, take it off and let it rest for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Now, cut into the perfectly crusted steak, and <strong>FEAST</strong> </li>
    </ol>
