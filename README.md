Okay, so clearly I am not a good coder, but I tried to utilize everything I have been taught so far in order to complete this project, I added my favorite foods, and honestly, I dont care what anyone says, I am so happy with it, I feel like im making true progress and at this point this is more of a journal entry.
It feels good to like, idk, complete it you know, its so nice to have worked so hard on something, and for it to be completely done.
Anyway, back to the coding part, I utilized unordered and ordered lists in order to present the ingredients and the steps, I used some text things like making things bold and italiziced (fuck idk how to spell) and I used hyperlinks and normal links, overall, I geniunely had a great time doing this, i like this.
