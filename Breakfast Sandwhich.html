    <p>Oooh, what do we got here you may ask? Now, this is a legendary meal in the Liver King household, this meal is specially crafted to my picky taste buds, and it is a college essential, it is extremely cheap, tasty, and quick! This is a breakfast sandwich on a plain bagel including an egg, some cheese, and some turkey! Man im getting hungry even thinking about this. This is such an easy meal to make, and a meal I have made multiple times in one day, it is delicious. Picture is not true size...or true dish.</p>
    <H3>Now what do we need to make this beautiful thing?</H3>
    <ul>
        <li>A plain bagel</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <Li>An egg</Li>
        <li>Deli slices of turkey</li>
        <li>Any seasonings you like!</li>
        <li>Franks red hot</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Okay, I know, you might be thinking, "wow, is that all? This wont be good at all" Haha, wait till you see... im also an extremely picky eater</p>
    <h3>Anyway, how do we make one? Ill show you!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Well, pretty self explanatory, toast your damn bagel! (dont burn it, made that mistake too many times)</li>
        <li>While your bagel is toasting, eat up a pan with a little bit of butter, and put that heat up to medium high heat!</li>
        <li>Crack your egg in the middle of the pan, and get ready</li>
        <li>Season your egg with anything you would like</li>
        <li>Around here, we fucking hate yolk, so you are gonna cook that so its well done!</li>
        <li>Now of course, dont forget, we dont have spatulas in the Liver King household, so flip that bad boy, and dont mess up.</li>
        <li>Now, while you are cooking your egg, butter your damn bagel!</li>
        <li>While that is almost done, take four pieces of cheap ass sliced turkey, and put that in the microwave for 15 seconds.</li>
        <li>You are almost done here!</li>
        <li>Place your buttered bagel onto a plate, slide the egg on, and place your turkey!</li>
        <li>See, you might be done here, but I am not, I put some franks red hot on that thang, and it is a game changer</li>
        <li>Now you are done!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Give this a try, and if you say you dont like it, you are getting a hit put on you for 6 dollars, because that is all you are worth. Enjoy!</p>
